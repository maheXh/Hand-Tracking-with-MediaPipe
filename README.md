Got it! If you've already added the body pose and face mesh features to your code, you can include that information in your README to provide a complete overview of the project. Here's how you can update the README template to reflect those changes:

# Multi-Purpose Hand, Body, and Face Tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This GitHub repository contains a Python script for real-time multi-purpose tracking using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. The script captures video from the webcam and uses the MediaPipe Hand, Pose, and Face Mesh modules to detect and track landmarks in the video frames.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe (mediapipe)
- NumPy (numpy)

You can install them using the following command:

```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```


## Features

- Real-time hand tracking: The script utilizes the MediaPipe Hand module to detect and track hand landmarks.
- Body pose estimation: Integrated MediaPipe Pose module estimates the 2D and 3D poses of human bodies.
- Face mesh tracking: Utilizing the MediaPipe Face Mesh module, the script performs real-time tracking of facial landmarks.
- Hand handedness detection: It identifies whether the detected hand is left or right and displays this information on the video frames.
- Frames per second (FPS) calculation: The script calculates and displays the FPS rate on the video frames.

## Upcoming Features

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements to our multi-purpose tracking script!
